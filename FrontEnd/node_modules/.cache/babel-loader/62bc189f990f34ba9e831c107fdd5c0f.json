Muscles make up only 25 to 30 percent of their total body weight. Most other mammals have a muscle mass that makes up 40 to 45 percent of the total body weight. Their specialised hands and feet have long, curved claws to allow them to hang upside down from branches without effort, and are used to drag themselves along the ground, since they cannot walk. On three-toed sloths, the arms are 50 percent longer than the legs. Sloths move only when necessary and even then very slowly. They usually move at an average speed of 4 metres (13 ft) per minute, but can move at a marginally higher speed of 4.5 metres (15 ft), if they are in immediate danger from a predator. While they sometimes sit on top of branches, they usually eat, sleep, and even give birth hanging from branches. They sometimes remain hanging from branches even after death. On the ground, the maximum speed of sloths is 3 metres (9.8 ft) per minute. Sloths are surprisingly strong swimmers and can reach speeds of 13.5 metres (44 ft) per minute. They use their long arms to paddle through the water and can cross rivers and swim between islands. Sloths can reduce their already slow metabolism even further and slow their heart rate to less than a third of normal, allowing them to hold their breath underwater for up to 40 minutes. Wild brown-throated three-toed sloths sleep on average 9.6 hours a day. Two-toed sloths are nocturnal. Three-toed sloths are mostly nocturnal, but can be active in the day. They spend 90 per cent of their time motionless.\"), React.createElement(\"ul\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 42\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, React.createElement(\"li\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 43\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, \"Lazy\"), React.createElement(\"li\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 44\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, \"Caring\"), React.createElement(\"li\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 45\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, \"Hanging\"))), React.createElement(Col, {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 48\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, React.createElement(\"h1\", {\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 49\n    },\n    __self: this\n  }, \"Pricing Section\"))));\n};\n\nexport default objectPage;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["C:\\Users\\uttam\\WebstormProjects\\ebuyonline\\src\\ObjectPage\\ObjectPage.js"],"names":["React","Row","Col","Breadcrumb","BreadcrumbItem","DisplayImage","objectPage","props","boxStyle","padding","img"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;AACA,SAASC,GAAT,EAAcC,GAAd,EAAmBC,UAAnB,EAA+BC,cAA/B,QAAqD,YAArD;AACA,OAAOC,YAAP,MAAyB,sBAAzB;;AAEA,MAAMC,UAAU,GAAKC,KAAF,IAAa;AAC5B,QAAMC,QAAQ,GAAG;AACbC,IAAAA,OAAO,EAAE;AADI,GAAjB;AAIA,SACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI,oBAAC,GAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI,oBAAC,GAAD;AAAK,IAAA,EAAE,EAAE,CAAT;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAED,QAAZ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI,oBAAC,UAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI,oBAAC,cAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KAAgB;AAAG,IAAA,IAAI,EAAC,wBAAR;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YAAhB,CADJ,EAEI,oBAAC,cAAD;AAAgB,IAAA,MAAM,MAAtB;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,yBAFJ,CADJ,EAKI,oBAAC,YAAD;AAAc,IAAA,GAAG,EAAGD,KAAK,CAACG,GAA1B;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IALJ,CADJ,CADJ,EAUI,oBAAC,GAAD;AAAK,IAAA,KAAK,EAAEF,QAAZ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,yBADJ,EAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,6kDAFJ,EAoBI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YADJ,EAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAFJ,EAGI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,eAHJ,CApBJ,CAVJ,EAoCI,oBAAC,GAAD;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,KACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,uBADJ,CApCJ,CADJ,CADJ;AA6CH,CAlDD;;AAoDA,eAAeF,UAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\r\nimport { Row, Col, Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem } from 'reactstrap'\r\nimport DisplayImage from './DisplayObjectImage';\r\n\r\nconst objectPage = ( props ) => {\r\n    const boxStyle = {\r\n        padding: '3%',\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return(\r\n        <div>\r\n            <Row>\r\n                <Col xs={5}>\r\n                    <div style={boxStyle}>\r\n                        <Breadcrumb>\r\n                            <BreadcrumbItem><a href=\"http://localhost:3000/\">Home</a></BreadcrumbItem>\r\n                            <BreadcrumbItem active>The Amazing Sloth</BreadcrumbItem>\r\n                        </Breadcrumb>\r\n                        <DisplayImage img={ props.img }/>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                </Col>\r\n                <Col style={boxStyle}>\r\n                    <h1>The Amazing Sloth</h1>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Their limbs are adapted for hanging and grasping, not for supporting their weight.\r\n                        Muscles make up only 25 to 30 percent of their total body weight.\r\n                        Most other mammals have a muscle mass that makes up 40 to 45 percent of the total body weight.\r\n                        Their specialised hands and feet have long, curved claws to allow them to hang upside down from branches without effort,\r\n                        and are used to drag themselves along the ground, since they cannot walk.
